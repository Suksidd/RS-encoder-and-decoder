# RS-encoder-and-decoder

Reed-Solomon error correction has several applications in satellite communication, in particular, forming part of the specification for the CCSDS digital communication standard.
Hardware implementation of coders and decoders for Reed-Solomon error correction are complicated and require some knowledge of the theory of the Galois fields on which they are based. 

This report describes the underlying mathematics and the algorithms used for coding and decoding, with particular emphasis on their realisation in logic circuits. Worked examples are provided to illustrate the processes involved.

The FPGA implementations of the respective Reed Solomon encoders and decoders were also done to understand the output and compare results of hardware and software. Despite the general nature of the topic taken this report is meant to give an approach to the hardware implementation of Reed Solomon encoder and verify the same using the developed c code.
